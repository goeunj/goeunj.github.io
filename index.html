                        This was an individual project done in an 'Introduction to Software Engineering' course.
                        Android Studio along with Java was used to create a custom themed mine sweeper game. 100% of 
                        the application theme, frontend development and backend programming was done in the span of 
                        two weeks.<br><br>
                        Additional features including background music, button sound effects and animation were 
                        added for a more immersive gameplay.<br><br>

                        This Covid-19 tracker was an individual project done in a 'Client Side Development' course. 
                        Angular, leaflet map API and an instructor-provided storage server was used to create a fully functional 
                        web application to keep track of the number of Covid-19 cases in all locations on the map.<br><br>
                        
                        The storage server was taken down by the instructor, so the web application no longer works. However, 
                        below are some images that showcase the overall look and functionalities of the web application.

                        This was a project from a UI design course. In a group of 5, we took a look at the SFU Canvas calendar 
                        to create changes that would create a more inclusive and efficient calendar layout.<br>
                        To do so, we had 3 iterations.

                        We held a cognitive walkthrough of our medium fidelity prototype and gave our user the following scenario:<br>
                        <br>
                        "You are a 1st year student attending SFU. You have chosen your classes and have signed up for a club. Looking at 
                        your calendar, you notice that the club is not showing up because it is not an official course at SFU. So, you 
                        decide to add a new calendar to represent the club."
                        <br><br>
                        We then gave the user 5 actions to complete without telling them the exact buttons to click.
                    </p>    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get "Add New Calendar" pop-up to display</li>
                        <li>Cancel adding a new calendar</li>
                        <li>Submit new calendar</li>
                        <li>Hide/show one of current calendars</li>
                        <li>Select January as the current month</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Overall, the user had no difficulties carrying out each task. Our prototype had very 
                        apparent and well placed functionalities. We also used icons that people are familiar with.
                        However, the user did take some time figuring out that the month/year had a drop down menu. If we 
                        had another iterations down the line, we would take these results and make efficient changes.

                        In a group of 3, we wanted to train and test 4 machine learning models for shape detection. 
                        <br><br>
                        TOOLS:
                        <br><br>
                        We gathered linear acceleration data and gravitational force data using the Physics 
                        Toolbox Sensor Suite app. The linear acceleration data allows us to record the change of direction 
                        and the g-force data produces cleaner images that we can visually see when the data is graphed.
                        <br><br><br>
                        SAMPLES:
                        <br><br>
                        We had participants physically move their phone to draw the predetermined shapes (O, S, V). Each 
                        participant went through the following steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Hold the phone flat, phone screen facing up
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each shape should be drawn within a 15x10in canvas (LxW)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Move phone at constant speed; Finish each shape under 5 seconds
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For each shape, we had the following rules:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start at the top left when drawing V</li>
                            <li>Start at the top center and move clockwise when drawing O</li>
                            <li>Start at top right when drawing S</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each participant used their dominant hand and non-dominant hand to draw all 3 shapes multiple times for variations.

                        <br>
                        The gathered data was cleaned by calculating the optimal standard deviations from the peaks and valleys of each shape.
                        <br><br><br>

                        4 MODELS:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Gaussian (Naïve Bayes) Classifier: We were not too interested in this model because it was not performing as well as 
                                the other 3 models. Hence, we did not tune the function for optimal results.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                K-Neighbors Classifier: This classifier had an accuracy score of 0.78. With n values less than 7, 
                                the accuracy score decreased, and was at its best when we set n to 10. 
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Neural Network Classifier: This classifier had an accuracy score of 0.84. With hidden units greater than 6, 
                                it performed significantly worse. With smaller alpha values, the accuracy increased. After some playing around 
                                with the parameters, we found that this classifier worked best with 1 hidden layer, 6 hidden units and 1e-3 alpha value.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Random Forest Classifier: This had an accuracy score of 0.94. Both the criterion Gini and Entropy resulted in high accuracy scores. 
                                However, entropy was chosen because the scores remained steady. Gini produced great results, but had some fluctuations in the scores and 
                                was not as consistent.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Overall, we found the Random Forest Classifier to be the optimal model for shape detection.

                        LIMITATIONS & EXTENSIONS:
                        </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect more data points</li>
                            <li>Participants had various ways of holding their phone (i.e., how much their phone was tilting upward/downward)</li>
                            <li>A template of each shape to draw would have made the procedure easier for the participants</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                        Above are some limitations we experienced. Making everyone hold their phones the exact same way and making 
                        everyone draw each shape the exact same way would definitely increase the accuracy of each model, when 
                        classifying each shape into their categories. However, it would reduce the "real-world" variance 
                        the model would be trained on. So, there definitely exists a trade-off, but with our project, we were aiming to 
                        determine the best model a developer could use to classify each shape to later create an application. This application 
                        could allow the user to draw a shape that would then trigger another application or function. For instance, drawing the "V" shape 
                        could dial "MOM".
